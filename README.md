# Klein

Klein helps you install, run, and control your node without needing technical skills as a public good product. Klein helps you install any testnet or mainnet node on Cosmos Hub and Cosmos App Chains. Everyone should be able to have a node in every chain they like without the obligation to learn what a shell command is. Klein supports you through every step of node management and gives you the chance to support the decentralization of the network while making your privacy its top priority. Klein does not ask, keep, save, or share any kind of information related to you or your node. With Klein, you can operate your own node in any chain you choose without writing a single line of code. As a public good product, Klein is entirely free and supports decentralization by eliminating the technical barriers between people and the blockchain validating process.

## Getting Started

### Home

Discover the testnet and mainnet nodes you can install with Klein. 

Select whether you want to install the Testnet or Mainnet version of the provided Cosmos chains. You'll see the minimum server requirements for each testnets when you click "install." Choose a cloud service provider and set up the node where you want to host any nodes (sentry node, full node, archive node, validator, or light client). Currently, we only provide the opportunity for servers that you can connect via an IP and password, but it is not going to be only for those (check out the "Future" part below for the details about incoming features and benefits).

### Automatic Installing

After you choose which testnet you would like to participate in, enter your IP address and password of your cloud server to establish a connection. Do not forget, and do not worry; Klein does not ask, keep, save, or share any information related to you or your node or server. Klein will automatically initiate the installation process on your server. You can monitor the progress and wait until the installation is complete. Do not close the Klein until the installation is completed. 

### Managing Your Nodes

### Node Operations

You can give commands such as "Start node, Stop node, Restart node, Update node, Delete node" on this page where you can perform operations related to the node you have installed. You can follow the "Sync Status, CPU, Memory" data of the node you have installed.

After the node is installed and synced with the latest block, you can recover an existing wallet or create a new one. This step ensures that you have complete control over your validator moniker name.

### Validator Operations

You can perform operations such as "Validator List, Add Validator, Edit Validator, Withdraw Rewards, Delegate, Redelegate, Vote, Unjail, Send Token, Wallets, Logs" of your Node from the Validator Operations section.
You can easily update your node with the latest binary versions, participate in network proposals, unjail your node if necessary, send tokens, delegate(stake) tokens to your node or other validators, redelegate tokens, and manage your wallets securely. Klein empowers you to perform all the necessary tasks and operations on your node without complex command-line interactions. It's a convenient and efficient solution for managing and maximizing the potential of your blockchain node.

### Node Information

With the Node Information section, you can track and manage your node, "Node Information, Sync Information and Validator Information" information. 

## Future

Our long-term goals and Vision

As a team that believes in the vision of Interchain, which acts with the vision of creating the Internet of Blockchains, we support decentralization efforts in all areas. As a validator team, we see large validator teams getting bigger and bigger and becoming centralized, in a way, in a world that operates on a philosophy of decentralization. Klein will ensure that anyone, anywhere, with any device, can validate any chain. Klein will enable you to validate any chain you want with your PC, mobile phone, VR glasses, Electric and smart vehicles, and even all your IoT devices, like your smart refrigerator. Klein cares about privacy and security as a core value of decentralization of the world, so Klein does not ask, keep, save, or share any information related to you or your node or server. We say; Your Private Key, Your Node, and Your Privacy. To achieve these goals, we focused on removing the technical competency barrier to the process of validating chains by moving people away from the terminal screen and writing code. We aim that the Klein platform connects everyone to Blockchains by validating them, just as Modems connect everyone to the Internet.
